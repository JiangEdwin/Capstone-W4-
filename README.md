### 1) Introduction/Business Problem 
### Clearly define a problem or an idea of your choice, where you would need to leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute. Remember that data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that you explicitly describe your audience and why they would care about your problem.  

The idea of this study is to help people who are planning to open a shop in Canada but do not know where to open and what shop to open. In order to solve this problem, the data about the shops of each neighbourhood will be collected. For instances, people A wants to open a caf√© but do not which location in Canada having high demand and which location having a lot of competitors or people B wants to open a shop in place A but do know what type of shop to open and number of competitors around there.   



### 2) Data 
### Describe the data that you will be using to solve the problem or execute your idea. Remember that you will need to use the Foursquare location data to solve the problem or execute your idea. You can absolutely use other datasets in combination with the Foursquare location data. So make sure that you provide adequate explanation and discussion, with examples, of the data that you will be using, even if it is only Foursquare location data.  

In order to solve the problem, the data that consisted of postal codes, neighbourhood and borough of Canada will  be collected. The number of shops of each neighbourhood will be collected through Foursquare API by combining with the data that consisted of postal codes, neighbourhood and borough of Canada. After combining the data, the data will be showed what are the shops at each neighbourhood and what type of shops are high demand.
